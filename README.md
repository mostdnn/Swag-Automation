Certainly! Here's a README file for your automation framework for the Swag website:

Swag Website Automation Framework
This is an automation framework for testing the Swag website, built using Java and the Selenium WebDriver. The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and includes four main packages: base, pages, testcases, and utilities.

Framework Structure
base: Contains the BaseClass that sets up the Selenium WebDriver and provides common methods for interacting with web elements.
pages: Contains the page object classes for different pages of the Swag website, such as LoginPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage, and LogoutPage.
testcases: Contains the test case classes that exercise the different functionalities of the Swag website, such as LoginTest, AddToCartTest, CheckoutTest, and LogoutTest.
utilities: Contains utility classes and functions, such as ConfigReader for reading configuration files and Logger for logging test execution details.
test_resources: Contains test data, configuration files, and any other resources required for the tests.
Key Features
Page Object Model (POM): The framework follows the POM design pattern, which separates the test logic from the web page implementation, making the code more maintainable and reusable.
Configuration Management: The framework uses a ConfigReader utility to load configuration settings from a central location, making it easy to change test environment settings.
Data-Driven Testing: The framework supports data-driven testing, where test data is stored in external files (e.g., CSV, Excel) and used to parameterize the test cases.
Cross-Browser Testing: The framework can be easily extended to support multiple browsers, allowing for cross-browser compatibility testing.
Test Cases
The framework includes the following test cases:

LoginTest:
test_login_with_valid_data
test_login_with_invalid_data
test_login_with_empty_data
test_login_with_press_enter
